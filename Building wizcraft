Building Wizcraft

1) Follow all of the instructions in "Instructions for coders" to set up you local GitHub repository
2) If you don't already have an Eclipse project for wizcraft, follow steps 3 - ??

For the next steps, you can follow this tutorial 
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w6uVI2dX2WeeULaZSL7_hoIsf-CE0tquy0nPfMPC7yU/edit) or do the steps below:
3) Create a folder called modding (or whatever you want to call it).
4) Download and install Elipse if you haven't already done this (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
5) Download and install "Java SE" if you haven't already done this (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html). Be sure you get the JDK not the JRE.
6) Download the Minecraft 1.7 Src lastest recommended here: http://files.minecraftforge.net/
7) Create a wizcraft folder under the modding folder you created above.
8) Open the zip file (lastest recommended was forge-1.7.10-10.13.2.1291-src.zip when I wrote this), and copy the files into the wizcraft folder.
9) Open a DOS command prompt and change to the wizcraft folder.
10) Run: gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
11) After the above completes, run: gradlew Eclipse
12) Now copy the files from GitHub/wizcraft/src to modding/wizcraft/src. 
13) Also copy the build.gradle file from GitHub/wizcraft to modding/wizcraft
14) Run Eclipse and when prompted for a workspace, select the modding folder.
15) From the file menu, select Import.
16) Open the General folder to select "Existing Projects into Workspace", and press Next.
17) At the top press Browse and select the modding/wizcraft folder.
18) The Finish button should now be enabled, so press it.
19) Under Package Explorer, you will now see the wizcraft project.

Now you need to create a Run Configuration (this is missing from the tutorial I linked to)
20) Select Run Configurations from the drop down by the green arrow in the task bar.
21) Right click Java Application and select New. For the Main class enter: GradleStart
22) Rename the Configuration to "Wizcraft client" (from the name section at the top).
23) Run it. After this, it will appear in the drop down and be the default when you press the green run arrow.
